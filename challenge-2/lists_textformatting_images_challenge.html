<center><h1>Duck Breast with Pomegranate-Citrus Glaze</h1></center>
    <center><p>Don't be intimidated by cooking duck at home — it's not just a treat for restaurant meals. This recipe is great for anyone who has never cooked the fowl before; it's the perfect special-night-in meal.</p></center>

<!-- this is the method of cooking the duck -->
<center><h2>Directions</h2></center>
<font size="4px">
    
    <p>
        Heat the oven to 400°F. Place the <strong>duck breasts</strong> fat side up on a cutting board and use a small sharp knife to crosshatch them, cutting just through the layer of fat but not into the meat itself. Sprinkle thoroughly with salt and pepper.</p>
    <p>
        Place them fat side down in a large skillet. Turn the heat on to low. Cook the <em>duck breasts</em> over very low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, letting the fat render out. The fat shouldn't spit or flare up; the heat should be low as possible. The goal here is to avoid cooking the duck breasts too much, and just to render off the fat.</p>
    <p>
        When the fat on the duck breasts looks cooked through and crisp, turn off the heat and remove the duck breasts. Carefully pour off all the liquid fat into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, unless you plan to use some right away.Return the duck breasts to the pan, fat side up now, and brush lightly with the <strong>pomegranate syrup.</strong>  Put the pan in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches your goal.</p>
    <p>
        Remove the duck breasts from the oven, place on a cutting board, and tent with foil to rest for a few minutes. Brush again with the glaze (rewarm the glaze if necessary) and slice very thinly. Serve immediately. I liked to serve thin slices of duck breast fanned out over wilted greens or radicchio, with sautéed turnips or root vegetables on the side.</p></font>
